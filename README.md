# Task Manager

A simple task management application that runs in the browser. This app allows users to create tasks, categorize them, mark them as completed, and edit them. Completed tasks can be reactivated or permanently deleted. The application uses `localStorage` for persistent task storage, so tasks remain even after restarting the browser.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Create new tasks with a name and category.
- **Category Filtering**: Filter tasks by category for better organization.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Completed tasks are moved to a separate list.
- **Mark Tasks as prioritized**: Tasks are colored yellow and moved to beginning of list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Existing tasks can be edited.
- **Reactivate Tasks**: Reactivate completed tasks and move them back to the main list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in `localStorage` and remain even after a browser restart.
- **Automatic Category Removal**: Categories with no associated tasks are automatically deleted.
- **Survive Browser Restarts**: Tasks are stored in `localStorage` for persistence across browser sessions.
- **Import/Export**: Tasks can be saved to and restored from file.
